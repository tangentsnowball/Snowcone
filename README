Scalable, semantic @fontface loving icon set for the world of today

This font set has been designed (with love) by the Tangent Snowball team to be an easily adjustable set of icons for use on projects where icons are required. Using a font set ensures all icons are fully scalable and only need one header call. It is currently in its infancy but we'll be expanding it henceforth. 

For demo, example CSS and @font-face ready fonts, take a look at the gh-pages branch
